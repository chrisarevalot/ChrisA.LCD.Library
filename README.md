## LCD.Library

I had problems using lcd libraries to work on a small project I was working on. So, I decided to write my own.
It was written using Atmel Studio 7, implemented on a atmega 2560 and a 20x2 LCD. This library isn't for general use as it hasn't been tested on other displays. (Timing and pin connections might be different.) 
File addition only applies to Atmel Studio 7, it hasn't been used in the Arduino IDE 

To use it: 
1) Download and save it in the same folder as your project.
2) Import/add it to your project as a library.
3) Include it into your main fucntion file. 
      #include "LCD_Full_Library_Sotto.h"
