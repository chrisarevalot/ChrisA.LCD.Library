## lcd.Library

I had problems using lcd libraries to work on a small project I was working on. So, I decided to write my own.
It was written using Atmel Studio 7, implemented on a atmega 2560 and a 20x2 LCD. This library isn't for general use as it hasn't been tested on other displays. (Timing and pin connections might be different.)
